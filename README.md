# Gray-scott-sim Professional Skills Coursework 1
The Gray-Scott model is a mathematical model used to describe pattern formation in chemical reaction-diffusion systems. This model is commonly employed to simulate the interaction between two reacting substances, where one substance is converted into another. Initially used to describe spot formation on the skin of zebrafish, the Gray-Scott model has found applications in various fields.

Here's a brief overview of the basic equations of the Gray-Scott model:
